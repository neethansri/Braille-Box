Android App ReadME:

In the Android App folder, there are two folders: BrailleBox and Receiver.

The BrailleBox folder contains the whole Android Studio folder. To edit/use the BrailleBox app, you need to download that folder and store it in the default directory "AndroidStudioProjects". This directory is where the projects are saved from Android Studio.

If you made your own directory, then just simply copy the BrailleBox folder in there.

The other folder is called Receiver. This folder contains the Receiver Java file and class. When this receiver code runs with the appropriate port number that is inputted into the app. A communication between the app and the machine running the receiver code is established.

Those are the two main things needed to communicate between the android app and the machine using the receiver script.
